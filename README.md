SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
Traditional Q&A-based interviews fail to assess real-world scientific problem-solving, adaptability, and collaboration. NeuroSync transforms recruitment into an interactive, AI-powered cognitive assessment platform, where candidates prove their abilities through immersive digital twin environments, real-time simulations, and AI-driven evaluation metrics.

Key Differentiators:
Real-World Problem Solving Over Theoretical Responses, Adaptive AI-Driven Interviews Instead of Static Q&A, Holistic Candidate Assessment with Cognitive & Biometric Data, Bias-Free and Blockchain-Secured Hiring Process


## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
NeuroSync integrates AI, immersive simulations, NLP-driven dynamic questioning, and biometric analysis into a multi-layered assessment framework.

Candidate Journey:
1. Pre-Interview Cognitive Profiling – AI analyzes candidate resumes & assigns initial challenge difficulty.
2. Immersive Digital Twin Simulations – Candidates solve real-world DRDO research scenarios.
3. AI-Driven Adaptive Questioning – NLP dynamically adjusts technical depth based on responses.
4. Biometric & Cognitive Load Analysis – Stress, focus, and cognitive patterns monitored non-invasively.
5. Scenario-Based Collective Intelligence – Team assessments for leadership & collaboration insights.
6. Quantum-Driven Adaptive Scoring – Probability-based evaluation, capturing interdisciplinary skills.
7. Post-Interview AI Projections – AI predicts candidate’s long-term research impact.
